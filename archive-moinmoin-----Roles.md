Here is the team report for our group Moinmoin wiki for school!

--------------------------------------

Our team name: WikiNets

--------------------------------------

Service: We'll run a Moinmoin wiki site deployment on a server and give detail on all required ports and services.

--------------------------------------

Group roles: Here are some roles below with a bit of info on how each person will go ahead with them.

* Research: Kasia

For research we'll look into installation and deployment of Moinmoin wiki, making sure that the compatibility and installation process runs smoothly and each group member is well-informed of the process and goals.

* Documentation: Ron

We'll make sure to thoroughly document as much of our group status and progress as reasonably possibly while also making further documentation to help prospective users have good reason to user our service.

* Testing: Yasir

We'll run the Moinmoin wiki and test each function. We'll comprehensively run deployment testing on each port and service to ensure the services work well. One of the main goals is to ensure uptime and functionality and notify other members of any issues.

* Support: Juan

We'll work with each group member depending on which items above need contributions while also working with the team ensuring that we're following the basic group framework.

--------------------------------------

Communication: We'll keep in touch both through weekly/bi-weekly meetings and also a continuous group text chat.

--------------------------------------

Tasks needed to build: We are planning to use our class server for installation and deployment of our wiki.

--------------------------------------

Protocols being used: We'll be using TCP/IP and HTTP(port 80)/HTTPS(port 443) as our first options and will likely add more as we discover them.
